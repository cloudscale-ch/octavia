features:
  - |
    It is now possible to create a loadbalancer with more than one VIP. There
    is a new structure ``additional_vips`` in the create body, which allows a
    subnet, and optionally an IP, to be specified. All VIP subnets must be part
    of the same network.
upgrade:
  - |
    To support multi-VIP loadbalancers, a new amphora image must be built. The
    new image is safe to upload before the upgrade, as it is fully backwards
    compatible.
